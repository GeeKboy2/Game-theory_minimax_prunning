This project is about implementing the Minimax alpha beta pruning methode of taking a playing decision on a type of games like Othello.
To understand the game : [Othello](https://www.eothello.com/).

# How to use

The only file you need to run is Othello.py. The algorithm is in the file "Minimax_alpha_beta_pruning.py".
Please ignore the file "save_duration.py" as it was used to draw the graph of time taken by the algorithm to take a decision.
